# Development

## Styleguide
Run `npm run styleguide` to start the styleguide, and visit `http://localhost:6060/` in your browser.  
Styleguidist should hot-reload your components as you work on them, but if this does not happen you should restart the styleguidist process.

## Running the App
Run `npm run start` to start a locally hosted version of the app, and visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

## Building the App
Run `npm run build` to build the app into the `build` directory, in **development** mode.  
Run `npm run build-prod` to build the app into the `build` directory, in **production** mode.

The distinction between development and production mode is reflected in the config values exposed to the app.
